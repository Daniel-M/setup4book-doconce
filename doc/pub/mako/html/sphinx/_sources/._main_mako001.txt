Use of variables
================

.. index:: variables in mako

.. index::
   single: mako; variables

Mako is the preprocessor that is always run prior to translating DocOnce
documents into a specific format. It means that your DocOnce source is
actually a computer program where you can use variables and functions.

Writing chapters that can both live their individual lives and be part of
a book faces some challenges for which we have some nice solutions
in the coming sections.

How to speak about "this chapter"
---------------------------------

.. index:: CHAPTER

.. index:: BOOK

.. index:: APPENDIX

In a book you will often need the phrase "this chapter", but his is
inappropriate if the chapter is a stand-alone document. Then you would
rather say "this document". Similarly, "this book" must read
"this document" in a stand-alone chapter.
We have resolved this issue by introducing
Mako variables ``CHAPTER``, ``BOOK``, and ``APPENDIX`` such that you
write

.. code-block:: doconce

        In this ${BOOK}, the convention is to use boldface for vectors.

For this to work, you need to define ``CHAPTER``, ``BOOK``, and ``APPENDIX``
as variables on the command line as part of the ``doconce format`` command:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format pdflatex ch2 --latex_code_style=pyg \
                  CHAPTER=document BOOK=document APPENDIX=document

When the book is compiled, you do

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format pdflatex ch2 --latex_code_style=pyg \
                  CHAPTER=chapter BOOK=chapter APPENDIX=appendix

The ``make*.sh`` files found in ``doc/src/chapter/`` and
``doc/src/book`` make proper definitions of
``CHAPTER``, ``BOOK``, and ``APPENDIX``.
