Mako's Python functions
=======================

.. index:: functions in mako

.. index::
   single: mako; functions

The if tests above are fine to handle larger portions of text. What if you
need to have four versions of just one word or very short text?
A Mako function, defined as a standard Python function,
is then more appropriate.

Basics of Mako functions
------------------------

Here is a definition of a suitable Mako function, which must be
defined inside
``<%`` and ``%>`` tags, using standard Python code:

.. code-block:: python

        <%
        def chversion(text_IT1413, text_IT1713b, text_general,
                      text_book1, text_book2):
            if COURSE == 'IT1713':
                return text_IT1413
            elif COURSE == 'IT1713b':
                text_IT1413b
            elif COURSE == 'general':
                return text_general
            elif COURSE == 'book1':
                return text_book1
            elif COURSE == 'book2':
                return text_book2
            else:
                return 'XXX WRONG value of COURSE: %s' % COURSE
        %>

In the running text you can call ``chversion`` with five arguments,
corresponding to the desired text in the five cases, and when ``doconce format``
is run, the value of ``COURSE`` determines which of the five cases that is used.
Here is an example on DocOnce text with a function call to ``chversion``:

.. code-block:: doconce

        It is extremely important to define the term *cure* accurately.
        Here we mean ${chversion('handle', 'handle',
        'resolve', 'treat', 'resolve')}.

You can easily use long multi-line strings as arguments, e.g.,

.. code-block:: doconce

        ... ${chversion("""
        Here comes
        a multi-line
        string""",
        'short string',
        'another short string',
        """4th
        multi-line
        string""",
        '5th string')}
        ...


.. admonition:: There are two types of Mako functions

   One type resembles Python functions, as demonstrated above. The other
   type employs a slightly different syntax and is exemplified in the file
   `doc/src/chapters/index_files.do.txt <http://tinyurl.com/kukz8pt/index_files-do.txt>`__. We refer to the `Mako syntax documentation <http://docs.makotemplates.org/en/latest/syntax.html>`__ for more information.

How to automatically generate a DocOnce file with repetitive structure
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To illustrate how Python and Mako can be used to efficiently
generate repetitive structures with a minimum of manual work,
we consider the following case. Suppose you have a DocOnce document
made up of a number of sections, where the DocOnce source of each section
resides in a subdirectory with name ``issueX``, where ``X`` is an integer
counter. You want to create a "master" DocOnce file that includes
all the sections, e.g..

.. code-block:: doconce

        ======= Issue 1 =======
        
        # INCLUDE "issue1/issue.do.txt"
        
        ======= Issue 2 =======
        
        # INCLUDE "issue2/issue.do.txt"
        
        ======= Issue 3 =======
        
        # INCLUDE "issue3/issue.do.txt"

Maybe issues come and go, and so do the subdirectories, implying that
one should automate the making of the above content of the master
document.

Generating a set of sections via Mako is easy:

.. code-block:: doconce

        <%
        sections = range(1, 8)
        %>
        
        % for i in sections:
        ======= Issue ${i} =======
        % endfor

Unfortunately, we cannot write

.. code-block:: doconce

        % for i in sections:
        ======= Issue ${i} =======
        
        # INCLUDE "issue${i}/issue.do.txt"
        % endfor

because the ``#include`` statement is run by Preprocess *prior* to
Mako's interpretation of the file.
Instead, we can generate (parts of) the master file in a separate
Python script. This makes it also easier to check which subdirectories
we have and set up the contents of sections based on the file
structure:

.. code-block:: python

        import os, glob
        outfile = open('master_section.do.txt', 'w')
        subdirs = glob.glob('issue*')
        # Run through all issue* subdirectory names in sorted sequence
        for subdir in sorted(subdirs):
            if os.path.isdir(subdir):               # directory?
                if os.path.isfile('issue.do.txt'):  # file?
        	    # Extract number X from "issueX" name:
        	    no = subdir[5:]
        	    outfile.write("""
        ======= Issue %s =======
        
        # INCLUDE "%s/issue.do.txt"
        """ % (no, subdir))
        outfile.close()

The master file can now just do an include of ``master_sections.do.txt``.
If the make script for compiling DocOnce to various formats first
runs the script above, the ``master_sections.do.txt`` contents are
up-to-date with the current file structure, and the contents
automatically propagate to the master document.

There is one potential problem in the above example: the ``issue.do.txt``
files may include figures with local paths. For example,
``issue5/issue.do.txt`` contains

.. code-block:: doconce

        FIGURE: [fig/myfig, width=500 frac=0.8] My figure. label{my:fig}

When compiling the master document, no ``fig/myfig.png`` is found because
the correct path, relative to the master document's directory,
is ``issue5/fig/myfig.png``. The same problem arises if there are
source code inclusion statements like ``@@@CODE src/myprog.f``.
The master document would then need ``@@@CODE issue5/src/myprog.f``.
The best way out of these problems is

1. Let figure and source code directories have a unique name,
   say ``fig5`` and ``src5`` in this example.

2. Create links from the master document's directory to
   all the ``fig*`` and ``src*`` subdirectories.

Point 2 can be automated by a little Python script:

.. code-block:: python

        subdirs = glob.glob('issue*')
        for subdir in sorted(subdirs):
            if os.path.isdir(subdir):
                no = subdir[5:]
                figdir = 'fig' + no
                srcdir = 'src' + no
        	if not os.path.islink(figdir):
        	   path = os.path.join(subdir, figdir)
        	       os.symlink(figdir, path)
        	if not os.path.islink(srcdir):
        	   path = os.path.join(subdir, srcdir)
        	       os.symlink(figdir, path)

This little case study shows the power of using scripts
to assist the writing process. Although Mako is very useful,
turning to a separate Python program that generates text is
even more useful. It is also much easier to debug a Python
program than Mako code.

How to treat multiple programming languages in the same text
------------------------------------------------------------

With these ideas, it becomes straightforward to write a book that
has its program examples in multiple languages. Introduce ``CODE``
as the name of the language and use if tests for larger portions
of code and text, and Mako functions for shorter inline texts,
to handle text that depends on the value of ``CODE``.
The author has successfully co-written such a `book <http://hplgit.github.io/Programming-for-Computations/pub/p4c/index.html>`__
[Ref1]_
for mathematical programming with either Python or Matlab - the version
is set when running ``doconce format``.

Here is an example of text, in the style of the mention book,
where there are small differences
depending on the programming language:

.. code-block:: doconce

        The following ${CODE} function `sampler` does the job
        (see the file "${src('sampler')}":
        "https://github.com/myuser/myproject/src/${src('sampler')}"):
        
        ${copyfile('sampler')}
        
        Note that in ${CODE}, arrays start at index ${text2('0', '1')}.
        Array slices like ${verb2('vec[2:8]', 'vec(2:7)')}
        go from the first index (here `2`) up to
        ${text2('*but not including* the upper limit (here `8`)',
        '(including) the upper limit (here `7`)'}.
        % if CODE == 'Python':
        Also note that the file `sampler.py` is a module, meaning
        that we can call all the file's functions from other programs,
        including `sampler_vec`.
        % elif CODE == 'Matlab':
        Also note that only the `sampler` function can be called
        from other Matlab programs. If we want the alternative
        implementation in function `sampler_vec` to be reused
        by other programs, this function has to reside in a file
        `sampler_vec.py`.
        % endif

Here we have made use of a few Mako functions to easily
choose between a Python or Matlab relevant text:

 * ``src`` for picking a filename with the right extension (``.py`` or ``.m``)

 * ``copyfile`` for constructing the right ``@@@CODE`` line for a Python or
   Matlab source code file

 * ``text2`` for picking the first (Python) or second (Matlab) argument

 * ``verb2`` for picking the first (Python) or second (Matlab) argument typeset in
   inline verbatim font

The exact Mako code appears below.

.. code-block:: doconce

        <%
        def src(filestem, url=None, verb=True):
            """Return filstem plus .m or .py."""
            if CODE == "Python":
                filename = filestem + '.py'
            else:
                filename = filestem + '.m'
            if verb:
                filename = '`%s`' % filename
            if url is not None:
                # Make link to the file at github
                pass
            return filename
        
        def copyfile(filestem, from_=None, to_=None):
            """Return @@@CODE line for copying a Python/Matlab file."""
            r = "@@@CODE "
            if CODE == "Python":
                r += "py-src/" + filestem + '.py'
            else:
                r += "m-src/" + filestem + '.m'
            if from_ is not None:
                r += ' fromto: ' + from_ + '@'
            if to_ is not None:
                r += to_
            return r
        
        def verb2(py_expr, m_expr):
            """Return py_expr or m_expr in verbatim depending on CODE."""
            if CODE == "Python":
                expr = py_expr
            else:
                expr = m_expr
            expr = '`%s`' % expr
            return expr
        
        def text2(py_expr, m_expr):
            """Return py_expr or m_expr depending on CODE."""
            if CODE == "Python":
                expr = py_expr
            else:
                expr = m_expr
            return expr
        
        %>

Compiling the document with

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> doconce format plain mydoc CODE=Python \
                  --latex_code_style=pyg

results in the output

.. code-block:: text

        The following Python function \Verb!sampler! does the job
        (see the file
        \href{{https://github.com/myuser/myproject/src/`sampler.py`}}{
        \nolinkurl{sampler.py}}):
        
        \begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,
        baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=2mm]{python}
        """Sampler module."""
        
        def sampler(...):
            ...
        \end{minted}
        
        Note that in Python, arrays start at index 0.
        Array slices like \Verb!vec[2:8]!
        go from the first index (here \Verb!2!) up to
        \emph{but not including} the upper limit (here \Verb!8!).
        Also note that the file \Verb!sampler.py! is a module, meaning
        that we can call all the file's functions from other programs,
        including \Verb!sampler_vec!.

Switching to ``CODE=Matlab`` gives

.. code-block:: text

        The following Matlab function \Verb!sampler! does the job
        (see the file
        \href{{https://github.com/myuser/myproject/src/`sampler.m`}}{
        \nolinkurl{sampler.m}}):
        
        \begin{minted}[fontsize=\fontsize{9pt}{9pt},linenos=false,
        baselinestretch=1.0,fontfamily=tt,xleftmargin=2mm]{matlab}
        % Sampler code
        
        function samples = sampler(...):
            ...
        \end{minted}
        
        Note that in Matlab, arrays start at index 1.
        Array slices like \Verb!vec(2:7)!
        go from the first index (here \Verb!2!) up to
        (including) the upper limit (here \Verb!7!.
        Also note that only the \Verb!sampler! function can be called
        from other Matlab programs. If we want the alternative
        implementation in function \Verb!sampler_vec! to be reused
        by other programs, this function has to reside in a file
        \Verb!sampler_vec.py!.
