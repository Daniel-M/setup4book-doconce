How to make several variants of the text
========================================

.. index:: if tests in mako

.. index:: boolean in mako

.. index::
   single: mako; if tests

.. index::
   single: mako; boolean

Sometimes you want to write some text slightly differently if the
chapter is a stand-alone document compared to the case when it is
part of a book. Mako if tests are ideal for this. Suppose you
introduce a Mako variable ``ALONE`` that is true/defined if the chapter
is a stand-alone document and false/undefined if part of a book. Then
you can simply write

.. code-block:: python

        In this
        % if ALONE:
        rather small
        % else:
        large
        % endif
        ${BOOK}

Running ``doconce format`` with the option ``-DALONE`` will turn ``ALONE`` to
true and the output is typically

.. code-block:: text

        In this rather small document

while for a book we skip ``-DALONE`` as argument to ``doconce format``,
which makes ``ALONE`` undefined, and we
get the output

.. code-block:: text

        In this large book

Mako variables can be defined/undefined (boolean variables) or be
standard strings:

.. code-block:: python

        % if SOME_STRING_VARIABLE in ('value1', 'value2'):
        some running text
        % endif
        
        ...
        
        % if not SOME_BOOLEAN_VARIABLE:
        some other running text
        % else:
        yet more different text
        % endif

With Mako variables, you can easily comment out large portions
of text by testing on some variable you do not intend to define:

.. code-block:: python

        % if EXTRA:
        This is
        text that
        will never
        appear in the
        output.
        % endif

Also, it is straightforward to write more than one version of a
chapter. For example, you may want to produce a version of a chapter
that is tailored to a specific course, while you for general publishing
on the Internet want a more general version, and maybe a third version
when the chapter is included in a book for the international market.
All this is easily done by if tests on appropriately defined Mako
variables

.. code-block:: python

        % if COURSE == 'IT1713':
        # Specific text for a course IT1713
        ...
        % elif COURSE == 'IT1713b':
        # Specific text for a the special IT1713b variant of the course
        ...
        % elif COURSE == 'general':
        # General text when the chapter is a stand-alone document
        ...
        % elif COURSE == 'book1':
        # Text when course is a part of a particular book
        ...
        % elif COURSE == 'book2':
        # Text when course is a part of another book
        ...
        % endif
