Tools
=====

You can start a new, future, potential book project by simply copying
the directory structure of the `setup4book-doconce <https://github.com/hplgit/setup4book-doconce>`__ repository on GitHub. Then you can follow
the instructions below to start writing and adapting the structure to
your project's needs.

Making a new chapter
--------------------

Under ``doc/src/chapters``
you find the chapters in this "sample book" as well as a script
``doc/chapters/mkdir.sh`` that creates a new directory for you with the
typical files needed for a new chapter. You can either edit existing
chapters, or make a brand new empty chapter by running

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> sh mkdir.sh mychap

This command makes
a directory ``mychap`` for a new chapter with nickname ``mychap``.
Files from the ``template`` directory are used to populate ``mychap``. You get
an empty ``mychap.do.txt`` where the text is supposed to go, or this file
can just include a series of smaller ``.do.txt`` files, and you get the
wrapper file ``main_mychap.do.txt`` such that you can compile this chapter
as a stand-alone document. You also get ``make.sh`` which calls ``../make.sh``
with the chapter main document (``main_mychap``) as argument. Optional
arguments for running ``doconce format pdflatex`` can be given to
``../make.sh`` in ``make.sh`` if needed (e.g., --encoding=utf8`).

Compiling the chapter
---------------------

PDF
~~~

To make a stand-alone document of a chapter, by compiling to LaTeX and PDF,
we propose the convention to have a ``make.sh`` in each chapter directory.
This ``make.sh`` can in most cases just call up a common ``../make.sh``
script,

.. code-block:: bash

        bash -x ../make.sh main_mychap

or optionally with some command-line arguments,

.. code-block:: bash

        bash -x ../make.sh main_mychap --encoding=utf-8

The ``doc/src/chapters/make.sh`` script is quite general and may be edited
according to your layout preferences of the LaTeX documents.

The present ``make.sh`` script creates two PDF files: one for printing and
one for electronic viewing. The difference is that all URLs in the
version for printing appear as footnotes (and just hyperlinks with
a dark blue color in the electronic version). The two files are
named ``mychap.pdf`` and ``mychap-4print.pdf``, respectively, and
copied to ``doc/pub/mychap/pdf`` for publishing.

**Remark.**
The suggested ``make.sh`` file
applies the ``--latex_code_style=`` option to ``doconce format``
for specifying the typesetting of blocks of computer code in LaTeX.
Originally, DocOnce applied the ``ptex2tex`` program to select such
typesetting, but the new method is more flexible and simpler (in that
it gives cleaner LaTeX code). (With ``ptex2tex`` one would need a common
configuration file ``doc/chapters/.ptex2tex.cfg`` to be copied by
``doc/chapters/make.sh`` to the chapter directory prior to running
`ptex2tex.)

HTML
~~~~

There is also a script ``doc/src/chapters/make_html.sh`` for making
HTML versions of the chapter. Just call this as

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> bash ../make_html.sh main_mychap

to make HTML versions of the ``mychap`` chapter.

The current version of ``make_html.sh`` creates four types of HTML
layouts and an ``index.html`` file with a list of links to these three files:
1) HTML plain Bootstrap style, 2) HTML Bootswatch readable style,
3) plain HTML solarized color style, and 4) Sphinx pyramid style.
(Note that the latter document is a true Sphinx document,
made by ``doconce format sphinx``, and from which one
could make other formats too.)

It is easy to go into the ``make_html.sh`` script and generate other
HTML or Sphinx styles.


.. admonition:: You need to edit the index file

   The ``index.html`` file generated by ``make_html.sh`` is made from the
   DocOnce source file ``index_html_files.do.txt``. This is a
   file utilizing Mako programming
   (see 
   the document `Use of Mako to aid book writing <http://hplgit.github.io/setup4book-doconce/doc/pub/mako>`__.
   There is also a similar file, ``index_files.do.txt``, listing all
   the published documents in various formats associated with a complete
   book projects (to go to ``doc/pub/index.html``).
   
   In the ``index_html_files.do.txt`` file, we define a Mako dictionary
   ``chapters`` mapping nicknames to chapter titles. This dict makes it easy
   to compile ``index_html_files.do.txt`` with a Mako variable ``CHAPTER``
   set to the chapter nickname and get a tailored ``index.html`` file
   for the HTML versions of that chapter. Similarly,
   ``index_files.do.txt`` also has a ``chapters`` dict and an associated
   ``published`` list with all the nicknames of the chapters that we want
   to list in the overview of the entire book project (all sufficiently
   finished chapters).
   
   The ``index_files.do.txt`` file gives a table of contents of all documents,
   so you will normally compile this manually now and then as
   
   .. code-block:: text
   
           Terminal> doconce format html index_files --html_style=bootstrap \ 
                     --html_links_in_new_window --html_bootstrap_navbar=off
   
   and publish it in ``doc/pub/index.html``.




Cleaning Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``make*.sh`` files generate a lot of files that can easily
be regenerated and that are normally removed from the chapter
directories. The script ``sh ../clean.sh`` can be run in any
chapter directory to clean up redundant files.

Compiling the book
------------------

Go to ``doc/src/book`` and run ``make.sh`` to compile the book. This requires
that ``book.do.txt`` performs the right include of chapters, table of
contents, and bibliography.

There are many other tools in ``doc/src/book`` too, e.g., the mentioned
library of handy scripts in ``scripts.py``, and an example on how to
pack all files of the entire book projects for publishing with Springer
(``pack_Springer.sh``).

The current book layout created by ``make.sh`` makes use of a (now outdated)
Springer T2 style for textbooks (requires the ``.cls`` and ``.sty`` files in
the ``book`` directory). Other Springer styles supported by DocOnce
are Lecture Notes in Computational Science and Engineering (monographs
and proceedings),
Lecture Notes in Computer Science (proceedings), and Undergraduate Texts
in Physics. Other book styles will require some manual work, either
working out a LaTeX preamble for a special style and use that when
compiling ``book.do.txt`` or actually extending the DocOnce source code.
