# Directory structure for a book project
<div id="setup:rules:dir_struct"></div>

.center[<img src="fig-rules/dirstructure.png" width=600>]

---

## Overview of the directory structure

 * `doc`: documentation
 * `doc/src`: (DocOnce) source for documentation
 * `doc/src/chapters`: source for individual chapters
 * `doc/src/book`: source for the book
 * `doc/pub`: published (compiled) documents in specific formats
 * `doc/web`: entry point (`index.html`) for GitHub web pages

Can have lots of chapters and more than one `book` directory if
multiple books are relevant.

---

## Directory structure within a chapter

Each chapter has a short nickname used in file and directory names.

 * Sample nickname: `ch2`
 * `ch2`: DocOnce source files `.do.txt`
 * `ch2/src-ch2`: source files for program programs, especially
   those to be copied into `.do.txt` files
 * `ch2/fig-ch2`: figures
 * `ch2/mov-ch2`: movies
 * `ch2/exer-ch2`: answers to exercises

The directories `src-ch2`, `fig-ch2`, `mov-ch2`, and similar may have
any subdirectory structure, but the names should as indicated here since
the setup for DocOnce books has many tools relying on the naming convention.

---

## The total directory structure

Here is a big project:


```
doc
  src
    chapters
      ch2
        fig-ch2
        src-ch2
        mov-ch2
        exer-ch2
      ch3
        fig-ch3
        src-ch3
        mov-ch3
        exer-ch3
    book1
    book2
  pub
    chapters
      ch2
        html
        pdf
        ipynb
      ch3
        html
        pdf
        ipynb
    book
```

---

## The `book` directory

 * One main file for the book: `book.do.txt`
 * `book.do.txt` includes chapters from `../chapters/ch2/ch2.do.txt`, etc
 * Scripts for compiling, spell checking, ...

---

# Newcommands

 * Files `newcommands*.tex` are treated by DocOnce as files
   with definitions of newcommands for LaTeX *mathematics*
 * Must be in the directory where `doconce format` is run
 * Use a common `newcommands.p.tex` for all chapters
 * `.p.tex` indicates that it can be run by preprocess and contain
   different newcommand definition for LaTeX and MathJax

Example on `doc/chapters/newcommands.p.tex`:


```
%% #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
%% Use footnotesize in subscripts
\newcommand{\subsc}[2]{#1_{\mbox{\footnotesize #2}}}
%% #else
%% In MathJax, a different construction is used
\newcommand{\subsc}[2]{#1_{\small\mbox{#2}}}
%% #endif
```

`make.sh` runs
typically


```shell
preprocess -DFORMAT=pdflatex ../newcommands.p.tex > newcommands.tex
# make latex versions

preprocess -DFORMAT=html ../newcommands.p.tex > newcommands.tex
# make html versions
```

*DocOnce newcommands are for mathematics only!* 
Do not use newcommands for general typesetting commands, use
Mako functions instead - they work for all output formats.

# Assembling different pieces to a book
<div id="setup:rules:book_assembly"></div>

.center[<img src="fig-rules/assembly.png" width=600>]


---

## Organization of DocOnce chapter files

 * Chapter nickname: `ch2`
 * DocOnce file: `ch2.do.txt`
 * `ch2.do.txt` may contain all the text or just include several
   files: `part1.do.txt`, `part2.do.txt`, `part3.do.txt`
 * No title, author, date, table of contents, or bibliography in `ch2.do.txt` - otherwise
   that file cannot be included in a book

`ch2.do.txt`:


```
# #include "part1.do.txt"

# #include "part2.do.txt"

# #include "part3.do.txt"
```

---

## Compiling a chapter requires a wrapper file with title, author, ...

To compile a stand-alone document for the chapter, create
`main_ch2.do.txt`:


```
TITLE: Some chapter title
AUTHOR: A. Name Email:somename@someplace.net at Institute One
AUTHOR: A. Two at Institute One & Institute Two
DATE: today

TOC: on

# Externaldocuments: ../ch3/main_ch3, ../ch4/main_ch4

# #include "ch2.do.txt"

======= References =======

BIBFILE: ../papers.pub
```

---

## Figures and source code

 * `fig-ch2`: figures
 * `src-ch2`: source code for program files

Important that figure and source code files have chapter-unique names
when combining all files into a book. Use `fig-nickname` and `src-nickname`.

Optional directories:

 * `mov-ch2`: movies in various formats
 * `exer-ch2`: answers to exercises, project work, etc.

---

## Assembly of chapters to a book

*Recall:* 
DocOnce = *Document Once, Include Anywhere*



 * Make `book.do.txt` for including chapters in a book
 * The entire book is in `book.tex` (!)
 * Compile individual chapters first - it is easier to track down a
   latex error in a chapter than going from `book.tex` to the relevant
   `.do.txt` file

---

## A `book.do.txt` file


```
TITLE: This is a book title
AUTHOR: A. Name Email:somename@someplace.net at Institute One
AUTHOR: A. Two at Institute One & Institute Two
DATE: today

TOC: on

========= Preface =========
\label{ch:preface}

# #include "../chapters/preface/preface.do.txt"

========= Heading of a chapter =========
\label{ch:ch2}

# #include "../chapters/ch2/ch2.do.txt"

# Similar inclusion of other chapters

========= Appendix: Heading of an appendix =========
\label{ch:somename}

# #include "../chapters/nickname/nickname.do.txt"

======= References =======

BIBFILE: ../papers.pub
```

---

## The book file relies much on running preprocessors

 * Sometimes debugging requires you to see the effect of running
   preprocessors
 * The effect of `# #include` and `# #if` tests are seen in
   `tmp_preprocess__book.do.txt` (input to `mako`)
 * The effect of Mako variables and functions are seen in
   `tmp_mako__book.do.txt` (input to `doconce` translation)

---

## The `book` directory must be coupled to source and figure directories

Running


```
Terminal> doconce format pdflatex book [options]
```

will most likely involve constructs like


```
@@@CODE src-ch2/myprog.py  fromto: def test1@def test2
```

but `pdflatex` sees no `book/src-ch2` directory! A local link
resolves the problem:


```
Terminal> ln -s ../chapters/ch2/src-ch2 src-ch2
```

Similar problems for figures!


```
Terminal> ln -s ../chapters/ch2/fig-ch2 fig-ch2
```

Auto-generation of all links (if `chapters=` is set correctly in `scripts.py`):


```python
>>> import scripts
>>> scripts.make_links()
```

---

## About figures when publishing HTML

 * HTML versions of chapters/book have `<img src=fig-ch2/fig1.png>`
   type of tags in the HTML code
 * There must be a `fig-ch2` subdirectory
 * *Copy* `chapters/ch2/fig-ch2` to the directory where the HTML files are published

---

# Tools

.center[<img src="fig-rules/tools.png" width=400>]

---

## Making a new chapter

 * Clone <https://github.com/hplgit/setup4book-doconce>
 * Go to `doc/chapters`
 * Decide on a chapter nickname
 * Create a brand new chapter: `bash mkdir.sh nickname`
 * Look at an existing chapter like `rules` to see syntax/details
 * Start writing in `nickname/*.do.txt` files, programs in `src-nickname`,
   place figures in `fig-nickname`
 * Edit `make.sh` if necessary
 * Compile chapter: `bash make.sh`
 * Include `../chapters/nickname/nickname.do.txt` with chapter heading
   in `doc/src/book/book.doc.txt`

---

## Compiling a chapter

To LaTeX/PDF:


```
Terminal> bash make.sh
```

To HTML:


```
Terminal> bash ../make_html.sh main_nickname.do.txt
```

The `doc/src/chapters/make.sh` script is quite general and can be edited
according to your layout preferences of the LaTeX documents.

There is also a script `doc/src/chapters/make_html.sh` for making
HTML versions of the chapter. Just call this as


```
Terminal> bash ../make_html.sh main_mychap
```

Three HTML versions with an `index.html` table of contents are generated.


---

## Compiling the book

Go to `book` directory and produce LaTeX/PDF book by


```
Terminal> bash make.sh
Terminal> bash make.sh nospell   # turn off spell checking
```

About book styles and tools:

 * Current example employs the Springer T2 book layout
 * DocOnce supports some other styles and, in general, a user-specific
   template for the preamble
 * `scripts.py` has function `pack_src` for packing all the
   `src-*` directories in a tarfile for book readers
 * `pack_Springer.sh` packs all needed LaTeX book files for publishing
   with Springer

---

# Study guides and slides

.center[<img src="fig-rules/students.jpg" width=400>]

 * Study guide: presentation of a chapter in a very condensed,
   effective, summarizing form for overview, use in lectures, and
   repetition
 * Slides: a good way of writing study guides

---

## Why is it so challenging to convert a chapter to slides?

Balance:

 * enough information for self-study by *reading* the study guide
 * minimized information for *viewing* and *listening* to an oral presentations
   of the slides

Many iterations and use of slides in teaching over and over again are needed!


---

## Slide directory

For a chapter `ch2`,

 * let slides be in `slides-ch2`
 * a chapter file `ch2/part1.do.txt` has its slide counterpart in
   `ch2/slides-ch2/part1.do.txt`
 * `ch2/lectures_ch2.do.txt` includes all relevant `slides-ch2/*` files and
   is the main file for the slide collection

Compile slides:


```
Terminal> bash ../make_lectures.sh lectures_ch2.do.txt
```

Note the possibility to turn the `TOC` on and off: Beamer has its own
table of contents, while HTML5 slides may benefit from having one.

---

## The `lectures_ch2.do.txt` file



```
TITLE: Study Guide: Some title
AUTHOR: Author Name Email:somename@someplace.net at Institute One
DATE: today

# #ifdef WITH_TOC
!split
TOC: on
# #endif

# #include "lec-ch2/part1.do.txt"

# #include "lec-ch2/part2.do.txt"

# #include "lec-ch2/part3.do.txt"
```

---

## The requirements to a slide collection

Tree purposes:

1. Read as a study guide to get overview before reading the
   full text of chapter
2. Watch as slides during an oral presentation
3. Read as a study guide to repeat and enforce overview of the material

Rules:

 * Make slides self-contained
 * Limit the information on the slides!
 * Make slides as visual as feasible
 * Use references to the underlying chapter text for details
