Newcommands
===========

.. index:: newcommands

Files with names ``newcommands*.tex`` are by DocOnce treated as files
with definition of newcommands for LaTeX mathematics.
These files must reside in the same
directory as the DocOnce source files. However, for a book project,
it is common to have one newcommands file shared by all chapters.
This file is placed
in ``doc/src/chapters/newcommands.p.tex`` and copied to a specific
chapter by the make script for that chapter. The extension of
the file is ``.p.tex``, indicating that the file has to be
*preprocessed* by ``preprocess`` prior to being copied. The reason
is that one occasionally wants the definitions of the newcommands
to depend on the output format (standard LaTeX or MathJax).
For example, subscripts in ``mbox`` font look best with footnotesize
font in plain LaTeX, while the larger ``small`` font is more appropriate
for MathJax. We can then put the following definitions in
``newcommands.p.tex``:

.. code-block:: latex

        % #if FORMAT in ("latex", "pdflatex")
        % Use footnotesize in subscripts
        \newcommand{\subsc}[2]{#1_{\mbox{\footnotesize #2}}}
        % #else
        % In MathJax, a different construction is used
        \newcommand{\subsc}[2]{#1_{\small\mbox{#2}}}
        % #endif

The make script will then run ``preprocess`` on this file,
typically

.. code-block:: bash

        preprocess -DFORMAT=pdflatex ../newcommands.p.tex > newcommands.tex
        # or
        preprocess -DFORMAT=html ../newcommands.p.tex > newcommands.tex


.. admonition:: DocOnce newcommands are for mathematics only

   Note that
   newcommands in DocOnce context are only used for mathematics,
   rendered by LaTeX or MathJax. Newcommands for other LaTeX constructions
   (such as section or boxes) should not be used in the DocOnce source
   code as these are confined
   to the LaTeX format. Use instead Mako functions.
