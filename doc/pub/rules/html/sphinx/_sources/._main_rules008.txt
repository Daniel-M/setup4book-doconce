Book versions with and without solutions to exercises
=====================================================

.. index:: solutions to exercises

.. index:: --without_solutions

It is easy to turn solutions to exercises on or off by the options
``--without_solutions`` (for ``!bsol`` environments) and ``--without_answers``
(for ``!bans`` environments). One often wants to publish a book
without solutions to exercises, but also make versions with solutions.
One possibility is to password protect the versions with solutions.

It can be wise to create a very complicated filename for the files
that may be shown in a browser with the URL visible for a class.
One possibility
is to create a 40 long SHA1 string as filename and start it with a dot
to also make it invisible in most operating systems.

.. code-block:: bash

        hash=82dee82e1274a586571086dca04d00308d3a0d86
        html=.trash<built-in function hash>
        doconce format html book --html_output=$html ...

The file following file, called ``password.html``, presents an empty page
with a button for providing a password, and if approved, the first
page of the book opens up.

.. code-block:: html

        <html>
        <body>
        <!-- password protected HTML page --->
        <script>
        function passWord() {
        var testV = 1;
        var pass1 = prompt('Please enter your password',' ');
        while (testV < 3) {
        if (!pass1)
        history.go(-1);
        if (pass1.toLowerCase() == "PASSWORD") {
        alert('You Got it Right!');
        window.open('DESTINATION.html');
        break;
        }
        testV += 1;
        var pass1 =
        prompt('Access denied - password incorrect!', 'Password');
        }
        if (pass1.toLowerCase()!="password" & testV ==3)
        history.go(-1);
        return " ";
        }
        </script>
        <center>
        <form>
        <input type="button" value="Enter Protected Area" onClick="passWord()">
        </form>
        </center>
        </body>
        </html>

Suppose your HTML file with solutions that you want to password protect has the
name ``book-sol.html``. Then you can simply do

.. code-block:: bash

        cp password.html book-sol.html
        doconce replace DESTINATION "$html" book-sol.html
        doconce replace PASSWORD "s!m!art|pass@word" book-sol.html

A PDF file can easily be password protected with the use of the ``pdftk``
tool. If ``book.pdf`` is with solutions, ``book-sol.pdf`` will also require
a password ``a!4``:

.. code-block:: bash

        pdftk book.pdf output book-sol.pdf owner_pw foo user_pw "a!4"
