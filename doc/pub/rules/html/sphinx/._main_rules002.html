<h1>Principles and conventions<a class="headerlink" href="#principles-and-conventions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>When starting a bigger project like one or more book projects, alone or
with others, it is wise to sit down and agree upon some basic principles
and conventions. This note is about a technical infrastructure for writing
books as an assembly of chapter components, but much more infrastructure
is needed to achieve an efficient work flow in the project. One simply
needs rules to make the work flow and end product coherent. This means one
must agree upon</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>mathematical notation</li>
<li>programming style</li>
<li>degree of modularization</li>
<li>writing style</li>
<li>student guide (slides) style</li>
<li>style in exercises, problems, and projects</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The suggestions here have grown out of the author&#8217;s own experience with
writing books and must be taken as just one possible example on how to
deal with the bullet list above.</p>
<div class="admonition-observation-latex-based-writing-styles-are-very-private admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Observation: LaTeX-based writing styles are very private</p>
<p>Most authors develop very private ways of using LaTeX in their projects.
They often have a vast amount of newcommands and a collection of special
LaTeX packages they rely upon. The result is that it might be quite a
challenge to combine two LaTeX-based writing projects, because of all
the special commands floating around.</p>
<p>With DocOnce and other quite simple markup languages, there are not so
many ways to do it and the source code becomes much simpler and easier
to integrate across projects and authors.</p>
<p class="last"><strong>Note.</strong>
DocOnce applies <em>a lot</em> of fancy LaTeX packages and HTML CSS styles,
but the associated LaTeX/HTML code is automatically generated and
steered via command-line options such that the complexity of
fancy admonitions or syntax highlighting is not visible in the
document the authors are writing on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mathematical-notation-and-newcommands">
<h2>Mathematical notation and newcommands<a class="headerlink" href="#mathematical-notation-and-newcommands" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="admonition-use-a-common-mathematical-notation admonition" id="index-0">
<p class="first admonition-title">Use a common mathematical notation</p>
<p class="last">I strongly recommend to spend considerable time on constructing a
set of newcommands in LaTeX that defines a <em>common</em> mathematical
notation for the project (and future projects). Think about
newcommands for vectors (arrows or boldface), matrices (uppercase
slanted or bold?, tensors, gradient, divergence, curl, etc.</p>
</div>
<p>Files with names <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">newcommands*.tex</span></tt> are by DocOnce treated as files
with definition of newcommands for LaTeX mathematics.  These files
must reside in the same directory as the DocOnce source
files. However, for a book project, I recommend to have a single
newcommands file shared by all chapters.  This file is placed in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">doc/src/chapters/newcommands.p.tex</span></tt> and copied to a specific chapter
by the make script for that chapter. The extension of the file is
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.p.tex</span></tt>, indicating that the file has to be <em>preprocessed</em> by
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">preprocess</span></tt> prior to being copied. The reason is that one
occasionally wants the definitions of the newcommands to depend on the
output format: standard LaTeX or MathJax.  For example, subscripts in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mbox</span></tt> font look best with footnotesize font in plain LaTeX, while the
larger <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">small</span></tt> font is more appropriate for MathJax. We can then put
the following definitions in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">newcommands.p.tex</span></tt>:</p>
<div class="highlight-latex"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">% #if FORMAT in (&quot;latex&quot;, &quot;pdflatex&quot;)</span>
<span class="c">% Use footnotesize in subscripts</span>
<span class="k">\newcommand</span><span class="nb">{</span><span class="k">\subsc</span><span class="nb">}</span>[2]<span class="nb">{</span>#1<span class="nb">_{</span><span class="k">\mbox</span><span class="nb">{</span><span class="k">\footnotesize</span> #2<span class="nb">}}}</span>
<span class="c">% #else</span>
<span class="c">% In MathJax, a different construction is used</span>
<span class="k">\newcommand</span><span class="nb">{</span><span class="k">\subsc</span><span class="nb">}</span>[2]<span class="nb">{</span>#1<span class="nb">_{</span><span class="k">\small\mbox</span><span class="nb">{</span>#2<span class="nb">}}}</span>
<span class="c">% #endif</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The make script will then run <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">preprocess</span></tt> on this file,
typically</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre>preprocess -DFORMAT<span class="o">=</span>pdflatex ../newcommands.p.tex &gt; newcommands.tex
<span class="c"># or</span>
preprocess -DFORMAT<span class="o">=</span>html ../newcommands.p.tex &gt; newcommands.tex
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition-doconce-newcommands-are-for-mathematics-only admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">DocOnce newcommands are for mathematics only</p>
<p class="last">Note that
newcommands in DocOnce context are only used for mathematics,
rendered by LaTeX or MathJax. Newcommands for other LaTeX constructions
(such as section or boxes) should not be used in the DocOnce source
code as these are confined
to the LaTeX format. Use instead Mako functions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="programming-style">
<h2>Programming style<a class="headerlink" href="#programming-style" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is fundamental for a book project to stick to one well-defined
programming style. I recommend to adopt the most widely accepted
style and adapt that to the project.
For example, in the world of Python programming, there is a style,
referred to as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</a>.
Personally, I am not fond of all the rules in this style, and
I intentionally break some of them, especially rules that forces
unnecessary vertical space in a book (although vertical space in
electronic books is for free, there is a strong tradition of
minimizing the vertical length of programs in books).
Fortunately, for Python there is are nice tools for checking that
a code follows the PEP8 rules, e.g.,
<a class="reference external" href="https://flake8.readthedocs.org/en/2.0/">Flake8</a> (see
<a class="reference internal" href="._main_rules008.html#ref1" id="id1">[Ref1]</a> for an intro).</p>
<p>For any programming language it is key to agree on how to use
white space in indentation, style of loops, identifier
names (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">my_funtcion</span></tt> vs <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myFunction</span></tt> vs <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MyFunction</span></tt>), white space
in function argument lists, etc.</p>
<div class="admonition-tip-make-a-1-1-mapping-between-mathematics-and-code admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip: make a 1-1 mapping between mathematics and code</p>
<p class="last">Computer code is very much easier to understand if you have defined
the problem it is going to solve in mathematics first. Reuse terms
and notation in the program, and try to make the key statements in the code
as close as possible to the mathematical formulation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="degree-of-modularization">
<h2>Degree of modularization<a class="headerlink" href="#degree-of-modularization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>My recommendation is to divide the project into as small modules as possible
and to make this modules as independent as possible. This is a very difficult
optimization problem. There is some kind of gravity force towards
big chapters and lots of cross-references internally and to other chapters.
For book composition and even more for course composition, smaller modules
give much higher degree of flexibility.</p>
<p>To make modules independent, the degree of cross-referencing between
modules must be modest, which forces a need to repeat material.
Repetition breaks a strong tradition in book writing. However,
moving away from strictly linear chapter-by-chapter book to a more
flexible set of modules connected in a graph, will induce repetition.
Readers also appreciate repetition, perhaps slightly differently phrased
with purpose, rather than being served with lots of references to
equations and codes in other chapters.</p>
<div class="admonition-tip-define-input-output-of-modules admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip: Define input-output of modules</p>
<p class="last">Ideally, modules should start with a well-defined list of required
background knowledge and a set of learning outcomes.
This information makes it easier to place the module in the
knowledge landscape.</p>
</div>
<p>Books with widely different writing styles among authors tend to be
confusing for readers. If the styles differ much, and it is difficult
to converge to a more coherent style, listing the authors together
with the chapter title is an idea to point explicitly out that
a different team is behind the present chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="student-guide-slides-style">
<h2>Student guide (slides) style<a class="headerlink" href="#student-guide-slides-style" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This note suggests to develop a book together with a <em>study guide</em>, i.e.,
a summarizing version of the material. An effective format of a study
guide is a set of slides, ideally a set that can be used both for
teaching and for self-study. The section <a class="reference internal" href="._main_rules006.html#setup-rules-slides"><em>Study guides and slides</em></a> explains
some infrastructure for producing DocOnce slides.</p>
<p>Some prefer to develop slides for a study guide first and then use this
as a skeleton for writing the running text of a chapter. Others prefer
to produce the slides from the running text.</p>
<p>The style of slides is even more important than the style of running text.
Slides for reading are not so sensitive to the style, but if the slides
are also intended to be used in teaching, the style becomes key.
Some comments on style are provided in box in the introduction to
the section <a class="reference internal" href="._main_rules006.html#setup-rules-slides"><em>Study guides and slides</em></a>. Rather than having boring headings a la
<em>Assumptions</em>, followed by a bullet list of assumptions,
I recommend to summarize the most important information in a 1-2 line
heading, e.g., <em>We assume a homogeneous material and no external forcing</em>.
The headings will then form a collection of the most important
information from each slide and be a very effective table of contents of
the material. The most important thing, though, is that different authors
stick to the same slide style.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="style-in-exercises-problems-and-projects">
<h2>Style in exercises, problems, and projects<a class="headerlink" href="#style-in-exercises-problems-and-projects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A central part of the writing style in a book is the division of
material between running text and exercises. DocOnce features three
types of exercises which can be effectively used in this context:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Exercise: smaller exercises tightly coupled to the text</li>
<li>Problem: smaller exercise that live its own life (without
references to the text)</li>
<li>Project: large problem</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Exercises are then used to repeat and train the material in the book.
Problems are used to explore new problem settings, while projects
are collections of closely related problems.
(The term &#8220;exercise&#8221; means in DocOnce context either an exercise in
the restricted sense or a common term for what we call
exercise, problem, and project above.)</p>
<p>The DocOnce exercise format has several useful features:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>hints</li>
<li>multiple-choice questions (quiz)</li>
<li>remarks</li>
<li>short answers</li>
<li>(longer) complete solutions</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Many students struggle with identifying the
problem setting (question) when too much information is comes at once.
Hints can be effectively used to separate the question from additional
information that is just supposed to help the reader. Remarks fulfill a similar
purpose and can separate fun facts or information that puts the problem
into a wider perspective. Short answers and full solutions can be
taken out of the document at compile time. (HTML Bootstrap styles
can fold/unfold hints and solutions/answers.)</p>
<p>Multiple-choice questions are typeset with the
<a class="reference external" href="http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/quiz/quiz.html">quiz environment</a>
in DocOnce. All quizzes can be extracted and uploaded as online
<a class="reference external" href="https://getkahoot.com">Kahoot games</a> where students can participate
via their smart phones.</p>
<p>It is possible to extract all exercises in a DocOnce document as a
separate document.</p>
