<span class="target" id="index-0"></span><p id="index-1">DocOnce has good support for creating slides. Especially if you
have ordinary DocOnce documents
with running text, it is an efficient process to strip down this
text to a slide format.</p>
<p>Rather than speaking about slides, we think of
<em>study guides</em> where the material is presented in a very condensed,
effective, summarizing form for overview, use in lectures, and
repetition. The slide format is a good way of writing study guides,
but by explicitly thinking of study guides the slide format can be
made more effective for self-study when overview and repetition are
necessary - with a particular emphasis on gaining understanding.</p>
<div class="admonition-slides-can-easily-be-too-crowded-or-too-empty admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Slides can easily be too crowded or too empty</p>
<p>It is a very challenging balance between enough
information for self-study by reading slides and the modest amount
of information you want in slides for oral presentations.
For a talk, you will (very) have little text on slides and rely
on figures. This is not so effective in a teaching and study guide
setting. Some text is indeed necessary, but it has to be minimized.
Michael Alley&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://writing.engr.psu.edu/slides.html">evidence-assertion</a>
slide design is effective: summarize the slide&#8217;s key point in a heading over
1-2 lines, use figures/equations/code effectively, and work on minimizing
text.</p>
<p class="last">Make it an assumption that the reader of a study guide is also
a reader of the underlying running text in the chapter.</p>

<h2>Generating slides from running text<a class="headerlink" href="#generating-slides-from-running-text" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The author has the following work flow for generating slides for a
chapter file, say <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">part1.do.txt</span></code>.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Copy <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">part1.do.txt</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">slides-ch2/part1.do.txt</span></code>.</li>
<li>Make <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">slides_ch2.do.txt</span></code> and include <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">slides-ch2/part1.do.txt</span></code>.</li>
<li>Decide on <em>parts</em> of the slide collection. Often a part can be
a section in the parent <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ch2.do.txt</span></code> file, but sometimes it can
be more natural to have larger parts than sections in the slide
collection.</li>
<li>Each part in the slide file has a DocOnce section heading  with 7 <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></code>, while
each slide has a DocOnce subsection heading with 5 <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">=</span></code>.</li>
<li>Edit <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">slides-ch2/part1.do.txt</span></code>:<ul>
<li>One can keep subsection headings from the running text for the most part,
but slides need many more subsection headings.</li>
<li>Try to let the heading summarize explicitly a conclusion/rule from
the slide (the slide table of contents is then a set of conclusions/rules!)</li>
<li>Remember a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">!split</span></code> right above very slide heading!</li>
<li>Compile frequently and look at the slides: they become over-full very
quickly so there is a constant need for dividing slides into new
ones with new headings.</li>
<li>Read a paragraph, focus on its main idea and result, and see how it
can be condensed to one sentence or a few bullet points.
<em>Making effective slides is the art of condensing the most
important information in the text to a eye-catching format.</em></li>
<li>Do not remove figures without a very good reason. Figures are important!</li>
<li>Add new images to live up the presentation. In slides you may think of
cartoons or entertaining images that would never be suitable
in a chapter/book, but they may help attract attention,
communicate ideas, and enhance the memory process.</li>
<li>Condense every mathematical derivation. Make sure the goal and end
result is clear before diving into details.</li>
<li>Detailed derivations are seldom of interest in a study guide or
oral presentation - refer to the underlying running text in the
chapter for the details. Focus on ideas and key mathematical steps (if they
are important enough).</li>
<li>Remember that equations are sometimes excellent images for ideas!
Complicated equations can therefore be important slide elements
although the details will never be addressed.</li>
<li>It is quite often wise to remove equation numbers in slides.
You can automatically remove them by <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--denumber_all_equations</span></code>, or
you can edit the LaTeX math environment manually.
Remember that
references to equations numbers must be removed from the slides too!</li>
<li>Movies are effective in slides. It is still a hassle to get them
displayed correctly in PDF files, so using a test on <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FORMAT</span></code> and
writing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MOVIE</span></code> for HTML output and just a link in PDF output
might be necessary. See the <a class="reference external" href="http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/html/manual.html#movies">manual</a> for how to work with movies in DocOnce.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The slides are to fulfill three purposes:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>reading as a study guide to get overview before reading the
full text of chapter,</li>
<li>watching as slides during an oral presentation,</li>
<li>reading as a study guide to repeat and enforce overview of the material.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is highly non-trivial to meet all these purposes: limit the
information on the slides, make them as visual as <em>feasible</em>, make them
self contained, and provide the <em>sufficient</em> amount of
information. Considerable iterations are always needed. Reading the
slides as a study guide is easy to accomplish. The slides&#8217; properties
in live presentations can only be tested by speaking to them (making a
rough draft of a video podcast is a very effective way of testing
the slides&#8217; quality).</p>
<div class="admonition-tip-use-quizzes-to-define-a-sufficient-preparation-level admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip: use quizzes to define a sufficient preparation level</p>
<p class="last">You want students to study the slides/study guide before a lecture.
To measure to what extent this is done, you can insert multiple-choice
questions about the most basic concepts in the slides (using the DocOnce
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">quiz</span></code> environment). With <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hplgit/quiztools">quiztools</a> you can extract all such
multiple-choice questions, create online games with Kahoot, and
let the students answer with their smart phones at the beginning of
a lecture.
The scores are visible to all on the main screen and communicate the
preparation level.</p>

<h2>Slides as IPython/Jupyter notebooks<a class="headerlink" href="#slides-as-ipython-jupyter-notebooks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I would add a fourth requirement to the list in the previous
section: a study guide should also be available
as an IPython/Jupyter notebook for experimentation, extension, and
personal notes. This is technically
straightforward by just generating a notebook from the slide source,
but a notebook puts some constraints
on code snippets and figure such that it is meaningful to execute
all the code. Moreover, many figures are inlined and appear as a result
executing code in a notebook. While other formats will show a code
snippet and then the corresponding figure, the notebook can leave
the figure out and let it appear as the code cell is executed.
Technically in DocOnce, this is solved by putting a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FIGURE</span></code> construction
inside an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span> <span class="pre">#if</span> <span class="pre">FORMAT</span></code> test (or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%</span> <span class="pre">if</span> <span class="pre">FORMAT</span></code> if Mako branches are
preferred). If <cite>FORMAT != &#8216;ipynb`</cite>, you have a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FIGURE</span></code> line, otherwise
the preceding code cell is supposed to generate the figure.</p>
<div class="admonition-notebook-from-a-chapter-or-from-slides admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Notebook from a chapter or from slides</p>
<p class="last">The book&#8217;s running text can also be converted to a notebook. However,
the notebook then consists of very much text and often a lot of
cross-referencing because this is the typically writing style of a book
chapter. This style is not so effective for a notebook. Stripped text
with focus on formulas, code, and figures is more ideal for a notebook
and this is the style of a study guide realized by slides.</p>

<div class="section" id="compiling-slides">
<h2>Compiling slides<a class="headerlink" href="#compiling-slides" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-2">There is a quite general script in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">doc/src/chapters/make_slides.sh</span></code> for
compiling a slide collection defined in a file like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">slides_ch2.do.txt</span></code>.
Just run</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>Terminal&gt; bash ../make_slides.sh slides_ch2
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>from the chapter directory. Note that the script will first spell check
the slide files. This is done in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">slides-ch2</span></code> directory. Errors are
reported in files located in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">slides-ch2</span></code>. To update the chapter&#8217;s dictionary
for spell checking, you need to do</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>Terminal&gt; cp slides-ch2/new_dictionary.txt~ .dict4spell
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ch2</span></code> chapter directory.</p>
<p>Similarly, to look at misspellings,
the file <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">``</span></a>slides-ch2/misspellings.txt&nbsp;`` is the relevant file.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make_slides.sh</span></code> script compiles a variety of slides:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>First a plain LaTeX PDF document to catch as many errors in the
DocOnce source as early as possible. This document can also be
used for compact printing of the contents of the study guide
(and the output looks definitely like a study guide and not slides!).</li>
<li>HTML5 <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reveal.js</span></code> slides with different colors.</li>
<li>HTML5 <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">deck.js</span></code> slides. This format is usually inferior to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reveal.js</span></code>,
but is also very much personal taste.</li>
<li>LaTeX Beamer slides. Edit the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">theme=red_shadow</span></code> line in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">make_slides.sh</span></code>
to control the Beamer theme.</li>
<li>Remark (Markdown) slides for viewing in a browser.</li>

<div class="section" id="ipython-jupyter-notebooks">
<h2>IPython/Jupyter notebooks<a class="headerlink" href="#ipython-jupyter-notebooks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<span class="target" id="index-3"></span><span class="target" id="index-4"></span><p id="index-5">Since DocOnce documents can be translated to IPython/Jupyter notebooks,
hereafter just called notebooks, it is tempting to produce a version
of the teaching material also in notebook form. This author&#8217;s experience
is that a more traditional book format with running text is not so
ideal for a notebook:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>you simply get too much text in a too long notebook,</li>
<li>the notebook needs more code snippets than what you want to show in
a book (or you just want to show fragments while the notebook requires
complete code),</li>
<li>there are many cross-references between equations, sections, figures,
and running text that the notebook does not support well.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Instead, making slides from the chapter&#8217;s text and translating slides
to the notebook format is a splendid idea. This requires some tuning,
as you want slight differences between classic slides and a notebook.
For example, a code snippet that results with a plot should contain
the plot in classic slides, while the notebook will automatically
produce it when run. This is easily fixed by an if test in Mako,
typically <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%</span> <span class="pre">if</span> <span class="pre">FORMAT</span> <span class="pre">!=</span> <span class="pre">'ipynb':</span></code> followed by a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FIGURE:</span></code> line
that includes the resulting figure for all formats except the notebook.</p>
<p>Also be aware of the DocOnce <em>hidden</em> code environment that can
be used to declare code blocks that appear in notebooks (because they
are needed) but not in other formats: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">!bc</span> <span class="pre">pyhid</span></code> gives a Python
hidden snippet.</p>
<p>Using notebooks as a starting point for a traditional textbook might be
a good idea, but will enforce a non-conventional style in the textbook.
For example, notebooks should be quite small, leading to similarly
small modules in the book. Notebooks use cross-referencing to little
extent, and this will be reflected in the textbook too. Notebooks also
need more code to run, so one has to accept more code in the textbook.
However, there is still a problem for the notebook with defining items
for an index, fancy admonitions, and other elements that one would
desire in a textbook. More experience is needed to make best practices.
Since notebooks can be compiled Markdown, and DocOnce can read
basic Markdown input, it is possible to go from the notebook format
to DocOnce, but this is not tested.</p>
