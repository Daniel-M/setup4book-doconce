Study guides and slides
=======================

.. index:: slides

.. index:: study guides

DocOnce has good support for creating slides. Especially if you
have ordinary DocOnce documents
with running text, it is an efficient process to strip down this
text to a slide format.

Rather than speaking about slides, we think of
*study guides* where the material is presented in a very condensed,
effective, summarizing form for overview, use in lectures, and
repetition. The slide format is a good way of writing study guides,
but by explicitly thinking of study guides the slide format can be
made more effective for self-study when overview and repetition are
necessary - with a particular emphasis on gaining understanding.


.. admonition:: Slides can easily be too crowded or too empty

   It is a very challenging balance between enough
   information for self-study by reading slides and the modest amount
   of information you want in slides for oral presentations.
   For a talk, you will have (very) little text on slides and rely
   on figures. This is not so effective in a teaching and study guide
   setting. Some text is indeed necessary, but it has to be minimized.
   Michael Alley's `evidence-assertion <http://writing.engr.psu.edu/slides.html>`__
   slide design is effective: summarize the slide's key point in a heading over
   1-2 lines, use figures/equations/code effectively, and work on minimizing
   text.
   
   .. With an ultimate construction of headings, the table of contents of
   
   .. slides will list all the key points of the material.
   
   Make it an assumption that the reader of a study guide is also
   a reader of the underlying running text in the chapter.




Slide directory
---------------

For each DoOnce file in the chapter ``ch2`` it can be wise to make a
corresponding study guide file in the subdirectory ``slides-ch2``.
For example, ``part1.do.txt`` has its counterpart with slides in
``slides-ch2/part1.do.txt``. Then there is a file ``slides_ch2.do.txt``
which assembles the parts if ``slides-ch2``, typically with a content
like

.. code-block:: doconce

        TITLE: Study Guide: Some title
        AUTHOR: Author Name Email:somename@someplace.net at Institute One
        DATE: today
        
        # #ifdef WITH_TOC
        !split
        TOC: on
        # #endif
        
        # #include "lec-ch2/part1.do.txt"
        
        # #include "lec-ch2/part2.do.txt"
        
        # #include "lec-ch2/part3.do.txt"

Generating slides from running text
-----------------------------------

The author has the following work flow for generating slides for a
chapter file, say ``part1.do.txt``.

1. Copy ``part1.do.txt`` to ``slides-ch2/part1.do.txt``.

2. Make ``slides_ch2.do.txt`` and include ``slides-ch2/part1.do.txt``.

3. Decide on *parts* of the slide collection. Often a part can be
   a section in the parent ``ch2.do.txt`` file, but sometimes it can
   be more natural to have larger parts than sections in the slide
   collection.

4. Each part in the slide file has a DocOnce section heading  with 7 ``=``, while
   each slide has a DocOnce subsection heading with 5 ``=``.

5. Edit ``slides-ch2/part1.do.txt``:

   * One can keep subsection headings from the running text for the most part,
     but slides need many more subsection headings.

   * Try to let the heading summarize explicitly a conclusion/rule from
     the slide (the slide table of contents is then a set of conclusions/rules!)

   * Remember a ``!split`` right above every slide heading!

   * Compile frequently and look at the slides: they become over-full very
     quickly so there is a constant need for dividing slides into new
     ones with new headings.

   * Read a paragraph, focus on its main idea and result, and see how it
     can be condensed to one sentence or a few bullet points.
     *Making effective slides is the art of condensing the most
     important information in the text to a eye-catching format.*

   * Do not remove figures without a very good reason. Figures are important!

   * Add new images to liven up the presentation. In slides you may think of
     cartoons or entertaining images that would never be suitable
     in a chapter/book, but they may help attract attention,
     communicate ideas, and enhance the memory process.

   * Condense every mathematical derivation. Make sure the goal and end
     result is clear before diving into details.

   * Detailed derivations are seldom of interest in a study guide or
     oral presentation - refer to the underlying running text in the
     chapter for the details. Focus on ideas and key mathematical steps (if they
     are important enough).

   * Remember that equations are sometimes excellent images for ideas!
     Complicated equations can therefore be important slide elements
     although the details will never be addressed.

   * It is quite often wise to remove equation numbers in slides.
     You can automatically remove them by ``--denumber_all_equations``, or
     you can edit the LaTeX math environment manually.
     Remember that
     references to equations numbers must be removed from the slides too!

   * Movies are effective in slides. It is still a hassle to get them
     displayed correctly in PDF files, so using a test on ``FORMAT`` and
     writing ``MOVIE`` for HTML output and just a link in PDF output
     might be necessary. See the `manual <http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/html/manual.html#movies>`__ for how to work with movies in DocOnce.

The slides are to fulfill three purposes:

1. reading as a study guide to get overview before reading the
   full text of chapter,

2. watching as slides during an oral presentation,

3. reading as a study guide to repeat and enforce overview of the material.

It is highly non-trivial to meet all these purposes: limit the
information on the slides, make them as visual as *feasible*, make them
self contained, and provide the *sufficient* amount of
information. Considerable iterations are always needed. Reading the
slides as a study guide is easy to accomplish. The slides' properties
in live presentations can only be tested by speaking to them (making a
rough draft of a video podcast is a very effective way of testing
the slides' quality).


.. admonition:: Tip: use quizzes to define a sufficient preparation level

   You want students to study the slides/study guide before a lecture.
   To measure to what extent this is done, you can insert multiple-choice
   questions about the most basic concepts in the slides (using the DocOnce
   ``quiz`` environment). With `quiztools <https://github.com/hplgit/quiztools>`__ you can extract all such
   multiple-choice questions, create online games with Kahoot, and
   let the students answer with their smart phones at the beginning of
   a lecture.
   The scores are visible to all on the main screen and communicate the
   preparation level.




Slides as IPython/Jupyter notebooks
-----------------------------------

I would add a fourth requirement to the list in the previous
section: a study guide should also be available
as an IPython/Jupyter notebook for experimentation, extension, and
personal notes. This is technically
straightforward by just generating a notebook from the slide source,
but a notebook puts some constraints
on code snippets and figures such that it is meaningful to execute
all the code. Moreover, many figures are inlined and appear as a result of
executing code in a notebook. While other formats will show a code
snippet and then the corresponding figure, the notebook can leave
the figure out and let it appear as the code cell is executed.
Technically in DocOnce, this is solved by putting a ``FIGURE`` construction
inside an ``# #if FORMAT`` test (or ``% if FORMAT`` if Mako branches are
preferred). If `FORMAT != 'ipynb``, you have a ``FIGURE`` line, otherwise
the preceding code cell is supposed to generate the figure.


.. admonition:: Notebook from a chapter or from slides

   The book's running text can also be converted to a notebook. However,
   the notebook then consists of very much text and often a lot of
   cross-referencing because this is the typically writing style of a book
   chapter. This style is not so effective for a notebook. Stripped text
   with focus on formulas, code, and figures is more ideal for a notebook
   and this is the style of a study guide realized by slides.




Compiling slides
----------------

.. index:: make_slides.sh

There is a quite general script in ``doc/src/chapters/make_slides.sh`` for
compiling a slide collection defined in a file like ``slides_ch2.do.txt``.
Just run

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> bash ../make_slides.sh slides_ch2

from the chapter directory. Note that the script will first spell check
the slide files. This is done in the ``slides-ch2`` directory. Errors are
reported in files located in ``slides-ch2``. To update the chapter's dictionary
for spell checking, you need to do

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> cp slides-ch2/new_dictionary.txt~ .dict4spell

in the ``ch2`` chapter directory.

Similarly, to look at misspellings,
the file ``slides-ch2/misspellings.txt |nbsp| `` is the relevant file.

The ``make_slides.sh`` script compiles a variety of slides:

 * First a plain LaTeX PDF document to catch as many errors in the
   DocOnce source as early as possible. This document can also be
   used for compact printing of the contents of the study guide
   (and the output looks definitely like a study guide and not slides!).

 * HTML5 ``reveal.js`` slides with different colors.

 * HTML5 ``deck.js`` slides. This format is usually inferior to ``reveal.js``,
   but is also very much personal taste.

 * LaTeX Beamer slides. Edit the ``theme=red_shadow`` line in ``make_slides.sh``
   to control the Beamer theme.

 * Remark (Markdown) slides for viewing in a browser.

IPython/Jupyter notebooks
-------------------------

.. index:: IPython notebooks

.. index:: notebooks

.. index:: Jupyter notebooks

Since DocOnce documents can be translated to IPython/Jupyter notebooks,
hereafter just called notebooks, it is tempting to produce a version
of the teaching material also in notebook form. This author's experience
is that a more traditional book format with running text is not so
ideal for a notebook:

 * you simply get too much text in a too long notebook,

 * the notebook needs more code snippets than what you want to show in
   a book (or you just want to show fragments while the notebook requires
   complete code),

 * there are many cross-references between equations, sections, figures,
   and running text that the notebook does not support well.

Instead, making slides from the chapter's text and translating slides
to the notebook format is a splendid idea. This requires some tuning,
as you want slight differences between classic slides and a notebook.
For example, a code snippet that results with a plot should contain
the plot in classic slides, while the notebook will automatically
produce it when run. This is easily fixed by an if test in Mako,
typically ``% if FORMAT != 'ipynb':`` followed by a ``FIGURE:`` line
that includes the resulting figure for all formats except the notebook.

Also be aware of the DocOnce *hidden* code environment that can
be used to declare code blocks that appear in notebooks (because they
are needed) but not in other formats: ``!bc pyhid`` gives a Python
hidden snippet.

Using notebooks as a starting point for a traditional textbook might be
a good idea, but will enforce a non-conventional style in the textbook.
For example, notebooks should be quite small, leading to similarly
small modules in the book. Notebooks use cross-referencing to little
extent, and this will be reflected in the textbook too. Notebooks also
need more code to run, so one has to accept more code in the textbook.
However, there is still a problem for the notebook with defining items
for an index, fancy admonitions, and other elements that one would
desire in a textbook. More experience is needed to make best practices.
Since notebooks can be compiled in Markdown, and DocOnce can read
basic Markdown input, it is possible to go from the notebook format
to DocOnce, but this is not tested.


.. admonition:: Remark

   More best practices for turning teaching material into
   books and into notebooks are supposed to be collected here in the future.
