Cross-referencing across chapters
=================================

A fundamental problem when writing a book *and* stand-alone chapters
arises with cross-referencing. In a book file it makes sense to refer
to an equation in any chapter, say (4.23), while in a stand-alone
chapter references to equations or sections in other stand-alone
documents will not work. That is, LaTeX has a native mechanism for
this, the ``xr`` package, where one can register a set of ``.aux`` files
for other LaTeX documents and refer directly to these labels and get
them right. It is then possible to write something like

.. code-block:: latex

        see (\eqref{sec:results:u:eq}) in \cite{Hansen_2011b}

and get it out as

.. code-block:: text

        see (2.37) in [12]

provided our ``.tex`` file contains ``\externaldocument{myother}``
and the label ``sec:results:u:eq`` is defined in ``myother.aux``. DocOnce
has generalized this feature so it works for non-LaTeX formats as well.
It is called *generalized cross-references*. You can then write
such references across chapters and get all labels right whether you
produce the entire book or individual chapters.

Syntax of generalized cross-references
--------------------------------------

Here is an example on a generalized reference to an equation in another
chapter:

.. code-block:: doconce

        The world's most famous equation is ref[(ref{fake:Emc2})][in
        cite{Langtangen_dobook_fake}][
        as found in the document "Some document":
        "http://hplgit.gthub.io/setup4book-doconce/doc/pub/fake"
        cite{Langtangen_dobook_fake}].

This sentence is rendered as follows in the present format (``sphinx``):


.. The below box could be typeset as .. admonition: Attention
   but we have decided not to do so (the box formatting is just ignored)

The world's most famous equation is 
as found in the document `Some document <http://hplgit.gthub.io/setup4book-doconce/doc/pub/fake>`__
[Ref3]_.


More detailed information about generalized cross-references is
found in the `DocOnce manual <http://hplgit.github.io/doconce/doc/pub/manual/html/manual.html#generalized-cross-referencing>`__.
In particular, one has to insert ``# Externaldocuments:`` commands in
all ``main_*.do.txt`` files that includes files with generalized
references.
