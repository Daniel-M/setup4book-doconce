Appendix: Use of Mako to aid book writing
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

**Remark.**
Documents that contain raw Mako code in verbatim code blocks cannot
also be processed by Mako, and this is the case with the ``mako``
chapter. Since we need Mako for processing the rest of this book
document, we are forced to compile the ``mako`` chapter as a stand-alone
document (with the ``--no_mako`` option) and let this appendix be just a
link to the `this stand-alone document <http://hplgit.github.io/setup4book-doconce/doc/pub/mako/html/index.html>`__.
