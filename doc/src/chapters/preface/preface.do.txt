The purpose of this ``book'' is to demonstrate a minimalistic setup
for making books in the DocOnce format. The setup contains several
useful features:

 o Chapters can exist individually and appear in different formats
   like HTML, Sphinx, and LaTeX-based PDF.
 o Chapters are flexibly assembled into a traditional LaTeX-based
   book in PDF format for a traditional publisher.
 o The book and the individual chapter documents may have different
   layouts.
 o Active use of preprocessors like Preprocess and Mako makes it
   easy to have different versions of the chapters (e.g., a
   version of a chapter document tailored to the special needs in
   a specific course at a specific institution).
 o Study guides or slides can easily be developed from the running
   text and stored along with the chapters.

These features have the great advantage that a book can evolve from
small documents, making the barrier for book writing much smaller.
Also, several appealing ebook formats can be produced, both for the
book and the individual chapter documents.

Implementation of point 1 and 2 is not trivial and requires some
rules that might not feel natural at first sight in the setup.
However, the suggested setup works for large-scale books,
including the Springer book ``A Primer on Scientific Programming
with Python'' cite{Langtangen_2014}. Individual chapters in various
ebook formats can be examined cite{Langtangen_TCSE6_looplist}.

To use this setup, you should have some basic knowledge of DocOnce,
including how to compile documents into the LaTeX format, how to use
newcommands in LaTeX, how to use Mako functions, and how to deal with
a bibliography, as these features are used in the setup. Some
familiarity with basic Bash programming is necessary since there are
many Bash scripts.
