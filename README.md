
Example on using DocOnce to write individual documents and assemble them
into a book that can be published in various forms and formats.
The goal is to lower the barrier for writing a book, but also encourage
the use of (parts of) book chapters in other documents (blog posts, extended lecture
notes, etc.).

The repo features a directory structure that can be copied as a skeleton
for a new future book project. The chapters document the ideas and
the suggested workflow.

> NOTE: This repo is in a *very* preliminary state!
