
The purpose of this repo is to describe DocOnce can be used to write individual documents and assemble
them into a book that can be published in various forms and formats.
The goal is to lower the barrier for writing a book by starting out
with separate shorter documents. With DocOnce these documents can easily be
published as classical LaTeX/PDF chapters, or online eversions
with modern HTML designs, or blog posts where readers can discuss.
The idea is to *document once* and have your writings in one and only
one type of source files and then automatically transform the information
to a variety of formats.

Also for those with very specific plans of writing a book in DocOnce following
the structure and rules in this repo can be a good idea since it gives
great flexibility in geting parts of the book out to potential audiences
during the writing process. One may, for example, produce a chapter in
a LaTeX/PDF PDF format that is particularly reader friendly on a smart
phone (`--latex_papersize=a6` in DocOnce jarogon).

The files in this repo constitute an example on how to organize a book
in DocOnce, so simply copying the repo itself and editing the
content is an efficient way to get started with a new, potentially
large writing project.
The suggested setup makes it also easy and natural
to generate slides from running text. The slides are often good
starting points for IPython notebooks (can be automatically generated).

The repo features a directory structure that can be copied as a skeleton
for a new future book project. The chapters document the ideas and
the suggested workflow.

> NOTE: This repo is in a *very* preliminary state!
