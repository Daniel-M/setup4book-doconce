### Why?

> The purpose of this repo is to describe how [DocOnce](https://github.com/hplgit/doconce) can be used to
> write individual documents and assemble them into a book that can be
> published in various forms and formats.  The goal is to lower the
> barrier for writing a book by starting out with separate shorter
> documents.

The documents can easily be published as
classical LaTeX/PDF chapters, or online eversions with modern HTML
designs, or blog posts where readers can discuss.  The idea is to
*document once* and have your writings in one and only one type of
source files, and then automatically transform the information to a
variety of formats.

Also for those with very specific plans of writing a book in DocOnce, following
the structure and rules in this repo can be a good idea since it gives
extra flexibility at no cost. For example, it becomes very easy to
produce versions of the book or its chapters that are attractive
for reading on a smart phone.

### Get started

To use this setup, just clone the repository and you have the
directory structure, the scripts, and example files to get started
with a book project at once! The source files for this book
(especially in `doc/src/chapters/rules`) constitute nice
demonstrations for learning about basic and advanced DocOnce writing
techniques.
