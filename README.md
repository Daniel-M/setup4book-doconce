
Example on using DocOnce to write individual documents and assemble
them into a book that can be published in various forms and formats.
The goal is to lower the barrier for writing a book, by starting out
with separate short documents, but also encourage the use of (parts
of) book chapters in other contexts such as blog posts and extended
lecture notes. The suggested setup makes it also easy and natural
to generate slides from running text. The slides are often good
starting points for IPython notebooks (can be automatically generated).

The repo features a directory structure that can be copied as a skeleton
for a new future book project. The chapters document the ideas and
the suggested workflow.
